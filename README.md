Prediction models  and accuracy calculation 
The Project implements various models to compute the accuracy of predictions :

--k-nearest neighbor algorithm with k = 7, on the Human Activity Recognition dataset, using the simple Euclidean distance measure to compute the distance between two samples.The percentage accuracy on test set is reported to be: 90.32%

--k-nearest neighbor algorithm with k = 7 on the VidTIMIT dataset, using the simple Euclidean distance measure to compute the distance between two samples.The percentage accuracy on the test set is reported to be: 98.4%

--a feedforward neural network on the training set with 1 hidden layer containing 25 neurons. The accuracy is dependent on the number of iterations performed by the network.


--The percentage accuracy on the test set is reported to be: 97.0% when number of iterations are 29.

--The percentage accuracy on the test set is reported to be: 97.1% when number of iterations are 32.


--The percentage accuracy on the test set is reported to be: 96.7% when number of iterations are 26.


-- SVM classifier with a polynomial kernel of order 2 on the training set and test on the test set.  
The percentage accuracy on test set is reported to be: 98.9%

--a SVM classifier for multi-label classification problem on Scene dataset. using polynomial kernel The percentage accuracy on the test set is reported to be: 65.36%


--a SVM classifier for multi-label classification problem on Scene dataset. using guassian kernel. The percentage accuracy on the test set is reported to be: 65.03%
